# MaOES
The MaOES program is a GUI implementation for the Evolutionary Strategy Based Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm. The program integrates several well-known scalable MaOPs test suites(DTLZ, WFG), which can be run on any Microsoft Windows platform. Interested researchers can download and validate the performance on his/her own.

The MaOES can obtain a well-converged and well-diversified Pareto front with much less population size and far lower computational complexity. The larger the number of individuals, the sharper the contour of the resulted approximate Pareto front will be.

The program is generated by the source code in our research paper. Now, the paper is still under review. The paper and source code will be available when our paper is accepted. : )
